## Description
This is a countrywide car accident dataset that covers 49 states of the USA. The accident data were collected from February 2016 to March 2023, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by various entities, including the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road networks. The dataset currently contains approximately 7.7 million accident records. For more information about this dataset, please visit here.

## Content
This dataset was collected in real-time using multiple Traffic APIs. It contains accident data collected from February 2016 to March 2023 for the Contiguous United States. For more details about this dataset, please visit [here].

## Inspiration
The US-Accidents dataset can be used for numerous applications, such as real-time car accident prediction, studying car accident hotspot locations, casualty analysis, extracting cause and effect rules to predict car accidents, and studying the impact of precipitation or other environmental stimuli on accident occurrence. The most recent release of the dataset can also be useful for studying the impact of COVID-19 on traffic behavior and accidents.
